"""LiveOrchestrator: bounded multi-round Band deliberation.

For each question the orchestrator runs up to ``max_rounds`` rounds of
agent collaboration in a single Band room:

  Round 1  draft + retrieve + capability + policy (Sales, Security, Product, Legal)
  Round 2  Featherless adversarial reviewer
  Round 3+ challenged agents rebut; reviewer judges again
  Round N  consensus OR escalation to the Human Gate

Each round-turn is posted via :class:`core.band_publisher.BandPublisher`
(JSONL first, REST second when ``BAND_MODE=live``). Human messages routed
through ``register_human_message`` advance an ``asyncio.Event`` per
question so the orchestrator can resume or restart a round.
